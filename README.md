# Allowlist File Automation (Python)

This project demonstrates a Python-based security automation script for maintaining IP allowlists through file parsing and safe rewriting.

## Purpose
This repository focuses on the **operational and automation side** of cybersecurity work, complementing detection and analysis examples found elsewhere in my portfolio.

The goal is to show how small, clear scripts can support:
- Access control hygiene
- Incident response cleanup
- Configuration consistency

## What the Script Does
- Reads IP addresses from a text-based allowlist
- Removes specified entries based on policy or security events
- Safely rewrites the updated list back to the file

## Security Context
Maintaining accurate allowlists is a routine but critical security task.  
This script reflects how automation reduces manual error and supports reliable enforcement of access policies.

> This is a simplified example of logic commonly used in security operations environments.
